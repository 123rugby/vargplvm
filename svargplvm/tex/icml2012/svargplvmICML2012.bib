  year = {2006},
  volume = {28},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {We describe a learning-based method for recovering 3D human body pose
	from single images and monocular image sequences. Our approach requires
	neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in
	the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression
	against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image
	silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation
	errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts
	descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge
	regression, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression, and Support
	Vector Machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases.
	The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance,
	and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance.
	The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery
	of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the
	method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using
	dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned
	regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting
	system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization
	over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images
	resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is
	demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both
	quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively
	on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6 degrees are obtained
	for a variety of walking motions.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic
	approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increased
	attention in the machine-learning community over the past decase,
	and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment
	of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning.
	The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targetd at researchers
	and students in machine learning and applied statistics.\\\\
	
	 The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression
	and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety
	of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties
	discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and
	a classical perspective. Many connections to other well known techniques
	from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector
	machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance
	vector machines, and others. Theoretical issues including learning
	curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation
	methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book
	contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets
	are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background
	and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

                  reduction. In this paper we extend the GP-LVM

                  structure. We first introduce Gaussian process
                  hierarchies through a simple dynamical model, we
                  then extend the approach to a more complex hierarchy
                  which is applied to the visualisation of human
