@string{gplvmAbstract1 = {It is known that Principal Component Analysis has an 
                 underlying probabilistic representation based on a
                 latent variable model. Principal component analysis
                 (PCA) is recovered when the latent variables are
                 integrated out and the parameters of the model are
                 optimised by maximum likelihood. It is less well
                 known that the dual approach of integrating out the
                 parameters and optimising with respect to the latent
                 variables also leads to PCA. The marginalised
                 likelihood in this case takes the form of Gaussian
                 process mappings, with linear Covariance functions,
                 from a latent space to an observed space, which we
                 refer to as a Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
                 (GPLVM). This dual probabilistic PCA is still a
                 linear latent variable model, but by looking beyond
                 the inner product kernel as a covariance function we
                 can develop a non-linear probabilistic PCA.

                 In the talk we will introduce the GPLVM and
                 illustrate its application on a range of high
                 dimensional data sets including motion capture data,
                 hand written digits, a medical diagnosis data set and

Instead, all the GPs in the mixture are global and samples are clustered following ``trajectories'' across input space. We use a non-standard variational Bayesian algorithm to efficiently recover sample labels and learn the hyperparameters. We show how multi-object tracking problems can be disambiguated and also explore the characteristics of the model in traditional regression settings.},

  abstract =	 {Recently there has been an increasing interest in regression
                 methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has
                 been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask
                 learning, multisensor networks or structured output
                 data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the
                 problem reduces to specifying an appropriate
                 covariance function that, whilst being positive
                 semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all
                 the data points and across all the outputs. One
                 approach to account for non-trivial correlations
                 between outputs employs convolution processes. Under
                 a latent function interpretation of the convolution
                 transform we establish dependencies between output
                 variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are
                 the associated computational and storage demands. In
                 this paper we address these issues. We present
                 different efficient approximations for dependent
                 output Gaussian processes constructed through the
                 convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional
                 independencies present naturally in the model. This
                 leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit
                 to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a
                 single output. We show experimental results with
                 synthetic and real data, in particular, we show

  abstract =	 {{\bf Background}\\\\
The analysis of gene expression from time series underpins many biological studies. Two basic forms of analysis recur for data of this type: removing inactive (quiet) genes from the study and determining which genes are differentially expressed. Often these analysis stages are applied disregarding the fact that the data is drawn from a time series. In this paper we propose a simple model for accounting for the underlying temporal nature of the data based on a Gaussian process.\\\\

{\bf Results}\\\\
We review Gaussian process (GP) regression for estimating the continuous trajectories underlying in gene expression time-series. We present a simple approach which can be used to filter quiet genes, or for the case of time series in the form of expression ratios, quantify differential expression. We assess via ROC curves the rankings produced by our regression framework and compare them to a recently proposed hierarchical Bayesian model for the analysis of gene expression time-series (BATS). We compare on both simulated and experimental data showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the current state of the art.\\\\

{\bf Conclusions}\\\\
Gaussian processes offer an attractive trade-off between efficiency and usability for the analysis of micro-array time series. The Gaussian process framework offers a natural way of handling biological replicates and missing values and provides confidence intervals along the estimated curves of gene expression. Therefore, we believe Gaussian processes should be a standard tool in the analysis of gene expression time series.},

For each putative target gene we fit a simple differential equation model of transcriptional regulation, and the model likelihood serves as a score to rank targets. The expression profile of the TF is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process prior distribution that is integrated out using a nonparametric Bayesian procedure. This results in a parsimonious model with relatively few parameters that can be applied to short time series datasets without noticeable overfitting. We assess our method using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) and loss-of-function mutant expression data for two TFs, Twist, and Mef2, controlling mesoderm development in Drosophila. Lists of top-ranked genes identified by our method are significantly enriched for genes close to bound regions identified in the ChIP-chip data and for genes that are differentially expressed in loss-of-function mutants. Targets of Twist display diverse expression profiles, and in this case a model-based approach performs significantly better than scoring based on correlation with TF expression. Our approach is found to be comparable or superior to ranking based on mutant differential expression scores. Also, we show how integrating complementary wild-type spatial expression data can further improve target ranking performance.}

                 to this data are required. In this paper we introduce
                 the variational Gaussian process dynamical
                 system. Our work builds on recent variational
                 approximations for Gaussian process latent variable
                 models to allow for nonlinear dimensionality
                 reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical
                 prior in the latent space. The approach also allows
                 for the appropriate dimensionality of the latent
                 space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate
                 the model on a human motion capture data set and a

                 consider employing the latent force model framework

These signals are conveyed onto auditory afferent nerve fibres. Neurotransmitter release at IHC ribbon synapses is controlled by L-type CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels, the biophysics of which are still unknown in native mammalian cells. We have investigated the localization and elementary properties of Ca2+ channels in immature mouse IHCs under near-physiological recording conditions. CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels at the cell pre-synaptic site co-localize with about half of the total number of ribbons present in immature IHCs. These channels activated at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials (about -70 mV), showed a relatively short first latency and weak inactivation, which would allow IHCs to generate and accurately encode spontaneous Ca2+ action potential activity characteristic of these immature cells. The CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels showed a very low open probability (about 0.15 at -20 mV: near the peak of an action potential). Comparison of elementary and macroscopic Ca2+ currents indicated that very few Ca2+ channels are associated with each docked vesicle at IHC ribbon synapses. Finally, we found that the open probability of Ca2+ channels, but not their opening time, was voltage dependent. This finding provides a possible correlation between presynaptic Ca2+ channel properties and the characteristic frequency/amplitude of EPSCs in auditory afferent fibres.},

                  models learned from training data make possible a
                  thorough and efficient search for the best

  abstract =	 {Recently there has been an increasing interest in
                  methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has
                  been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask
                  learning, multisensor networks or structured output
                  data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the
                  problem reduces to specifying an appropriate
                  covariance function that, whilst being positive
                  semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all
                  the data points and across all the outputs. One
                  approach to account for non-trivial correlations
                  between outputs employs convolution processes. Under
                  a latent function interpretation of the convolution
                  transform we establish dependencies between output
                  variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are
                  the associated computational and storage demands. In
                  this paper we address these issues. We present
                  different sparse approximations for dependent output
                  Gaussian processes constructed through the
                  convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional
                  independencies present naturally in the model. This
                  leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit
                  to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a
                  single output. We show experimental results with
                  synthetic and real data, in particular, we show
                  results in pollution prediction, school exams score
                  prediction and gene expression data.},

  abstract =	 {{\bf Background}\\\\ Most analyses of microarray
                  data are based on point estimates of expression
                  levels and ignore the uncertainty of such
                  estimates. By determining uncertainties from
                  Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating these
                  uncertainties to downstream analyses it has been
                  shown that we can improve results of differential
                  expression detection, principal component analysis
                  and clustering. Previously, implementations of these
                  uncertainty propagation methods have only been
                  available as separate packages, written in different
                  languages. Previous implementations have also
                  suffered from being very costly to compute, and in
                  the case of differential expression detection, have
                  been limited in the experimental designs to which
                  they can be applied.\\\\ {\bf Results}\\\\ puma is a
                  Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of
                  analysis methods for use on Affymetrix GeneChip
                  data. puma extends the differential expression
                  detection methods of previous work from the 2-class
                  case to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used
                  to automatically create design and contrast matrices
                  for typical experimental designs, which can be used
                  both within the package itself but also in other
                  Bioconductor packages. The implementation of
                  differential expression detection methods has been
                  parallelised leading to significant decreases in
                  processing time on a range of computer
                  architectures. puma incorporates the first R
                  implementation of an uncertainty propagation version
                  of principal component analysis, and an
                  implementation of a clustering method based on
                  uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques are
                  brought together in a single, easy-to-use package
                  with clear, task-based documentation.\\\\ {\bf
                  Conclusions}\\\\ For the first time, the puma
                  package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation
                  methods available to a general audience. These
                  methods can be used to improve results from more
                  traditional analyses of microarray data. puma also
                  offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of
                  execution over previously available methods. puma is
                  recommended for anyone working with the Affymetrix
                  GeneChip platform for gene expression analysis and
                  can also be applied more generally.},

  abstract =	 {Purely data driven approaches for machine learning
                  present difficulties when data is scarce relative to
                  the complexity of the model or when the model is
                  forced to extrapolate. On the other hand, purely
                  mechanistic approaches need to identify and specify
                  all the interactions in the problem at hand (which
                  may not be feasible) and still leave the issue of
                  how to parameterize the system. In this paper, we
                  present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes
                  and differential equations to combine data driven
                  modeling with a physical model of the system. We
                  show how different, physically-inspired, kernel
                  functions can be developed through sensible, simple,
                  mechanistic assumptions about the underlying
                  system. The versatility of our approach is
                  illustrated with three case studies from
                  computational biology, motion capture and
                  geostatistics.},

                  scenario where the representation are
                  complementary. This implies that a single individual
                  representation is not sufficient to fully
                  discriminate a specific instance of the underlying
                  phenomenon, it also means that each representation
                  is an ambiguous representation of the other
                  complementary spaces. In this paper we present a
                  latent variable model capable of consolidating
                  multiple complementary representations. Our method
                  extends canonical correlation analysis by
                  introducing additional latent spaces that are
                  specific to the different representations, thereby
                  explaining the full variance of the
                  observations. These additional spaces, explaining
                  representation specific variance, separately model
                  the variance in a representation ambiguous to the
                  other. We develop a spectral algorithm for fast
                  computation of the embeddings and a probabilistic
                  model (based on Gaussian processes) for validation
                  and inference. The proposed model has several

                  conditions by glimpsing time-frequency regions where
                  the target speech is dominant. Previous
                  computational attempts to identify such regions have
                  been source-driven, using primitive cues. This paper
                  describes a model-driven approach in which the
                  likelihood of spectro-temporal patches of a noisy
                  mixture representing speech is given by a generative
                  model. The focus is on patch size and patch
                  modelling. Small patches lead to a lack of
                  discrimination, while large patches are more likely
                  to contain contributions from other sources. A
                  cleanness measure reveals that a good patch size is
                  one which extends over a quarter of the speech
                  frequency range and lasts for 40 ms. Gaussian
                  mixture models are used to represent patches. A
                  compact representation based on a 2D discrete cosine
                  transform leads to reasonable speech/background
                  discrimination.},

                  species} in biochemical interaction networks is a
                  key problem in estimation of the structure and
                  parameters of the genetic, metabolic and protein
                  interaction networks that underpin all biological
                  processes. We present a framework for Bayesian
                  marginalisation of these latent chemical species
                  through Gaussian process priors.\\\\ {\bf Results:}
                  We demonstrate our general approach on three
                  different biological examples of single input
                  motifs, including both activation and repression of
                  transcription. We focus in particular on the problem
                  of inferring transcription factor activity when the
                  concentration of active protein cannot easily be
                  measured. We show how the uncertainty in the
                  inferred transcription factor activity can be
                  integrated out in order to derive a likelihood
                  function that can be used for the estimation of
                  regulatory model parameters. An advantage of our
                  approach is that we avoid the use of a
                  coarse-grained discretization of continuous-time
                  functions, which would lead to a large number of
                  additional parameters to be estimated. We develop
                  efficient exact and approximate inference schemes,
                  which are much more efficient than competing
                  sampling-based schemes and therefore provide us with
                  a practical toolkit for model-based inference.\\\\

                  signal strengths, has been shown to be an accurate
                  method of indoor and outdoor localization and a
                  powerful building block for location-aware
                  applications. However, most localization techniques
                  require a training set of signal strength readings
                  labeled against a ground truth location map, which
                  is prohibitive to collect and maintain as maps grow

                  regulatory relationship between transcription
                  factors and genes is a fundamental stepping stone
                  when trying to develop models of cellular
                  processes. Recent experimental high-throughput
                  techniques such as Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                  provide important information about the architecture
                  of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it
                  is very difficult to measure the concentration
                  levels of transcription factor proteins and
                  determine their regulatory effect on gene
                  transcription. It is therefore an important
                  computational challenge to infer these quantities
                  using gene expression data and network architecture
                  data.\\\\ {\bf Results}: We develop a probabilistic
                  state space model that allows genome-wide inference
                  of both transcription factor protein concentrations
                  and their effect on the transcription rates of each
                  target gene from microarray data. We use variational
                  inference techniques to learn the model parameters
                  and perform posterior inference of protein
                  concentrations and regulatory strengths. The
                  probabilistic nature of the model also means that we
                  can associate credibility intervals to our
                  estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect
                  which binding events lead to significant

                  data and on two yeast data sets in which the network
                  structure has previously been obtained using
                  Chromatine Immunoprecipitation data. Predictions

  abstract =	 {{\bf Motivation:} Finding differentially expressed
                  genes is a fundamental objective of a microarray
                  experiment. Numerous methods have been proposed to
                  perform this task. Existing methods are based on
                  point estimates of gene expression level obtained
                  from each microarray experiment. This approach
                  discards potentially useful information about
                  measurement error that can be obtained from an
                  appropriate probe-level analysis. Probabilistic
                  probe-level models can be used to measure gene
                  expression and also provide a level of uncertainty
                  in this measurement. This probe-level variance
                  provides useful information which can help in the
                  identification of differentially expressed
                  genes.\\\\ {\bf Results:} We propose a Bayesian
                  method to include probe-level variances into the
                  detection of differentially expressed genes from
                  replicated experiments. A variational approximation
                  is used for effcient parameter estimation. We
                  compare this approximation with MAP and MCMC
                  parameter estimation in terms of computational
                  effciency and accuracy. The method is used to
                  calculate the probability of positive log-ratio
                  (PPLR) of expression levels between
                  conditions. Using the measurements from a recently
                  developed Affymetrix probe-level model, multi-mgMOS,
                  we test PPLR on a spike-in data set and a mouse
                  time-course data set. Results show that the
                  inclusion of probelevel measurement error improves
                  accuracy in detecting differential gene
                  expression.\\\\ {\bf Availability:} The methods
                  described in this paper have been implemented in an

                  directly identifying the architecture of regulatory
                  networks on a genome-wide scale. However, the
                  computational task of estimating fine-grained models
                  on a genome-wide scale is daunting. Therefore, it is
                  of great importance to be able to reliably identify
                  submodules of the network that can be effectively
                  modelled as independent subunits. In this paper we
                  present a procedure to obtain submodules of a
                  cellular network by using information from
                  gene-expression measurements. We integrate network
                  architecture data with genome-wide gene expression
                  measurements in order to determine which regulatory
                  relations are actually confirmed by the expression
                  data. We then use this information to obtain
                  non-trivial submodules of the regulatory network
                  using two distinct algorithms, a naive exhaustive
                  algorithm and a spectral algorithm based on the
                  eigendecomposition of an affinity matrix. We test

A major challenge in the analysis of such studies are hidden confounding factors, such as unobserved covariates or unknown environmental influences. These factors can induce a pronounced artifactual correlation structure in the expression profiles, which may create spurious false associations or mask real genetic association signals.\\\\

Here, we report PANAMA (Probabilistic ANAlysis of genoMic dAta), a novel probabilistic model to account for confounding factors within an
eQTL analysis. In contrast to previous methods, PANAMA learns hidden factors jointly with the effect of prominent genetic regulators. As a result, PANAMA can more accurately distinguish between true genetic association signals and confounding variation.\\\\

We applied our model and compared it to existing methods on a variety of datasets and biological systems. PANAMA consistently performs better than alternative methods, and finds in particular substantially more trans regulators. Importantly, PANAMA not only identified a greater number of associations, but also yields hits that are biologically more plausible and can be better reproduced between independent studies.},

                  is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction
                  techniques for the analysis of high-dimensional
                  datasets. However, in its standard form, it does not
                  take into account any error measures associated with
                  the data points beyond a standard spherical
                  noise. This indiscriminate nature provides one of
                  its main weaknesses when applied to biological data
                  with inherently large variability, such as
                  expression levels measured with microarrays. Methods
                  now exist for extracting credibility intervals from
                  the probe-level analysis of cDNA and oligonucleotide
                  microarray experiments. These credibility intervals
                  are gene and experiment specific, and can be
                  propagated through an appropriate probabilistic
                  downstream analysis.\\\\ {\bf Results:} We propose a
                  new model-based approach to PCA that takes into
                  account the variances associated with each gene in
                  each experiment. We develop an efficient
                  EM-algorithm to estimate the parameters of our new

                  results than standard PCA, while remaining
                  computationally reasonable. We show how the model
                  can be used to 'denoise' a microarray dataset
                  leading to improved expression profiles and tighter
                  clustering across profiles. The probabilistic nature

                  is a generative approach to non-linear low
                  dimensional embedding, that provides a smooth
                  probabilistic mapping from latent to data space. It
                  is also a non-linear generalization of probabilistic
                  PCA (PPCA) \cite{Tipping:probpca99}. While most
                  approaches to non-linear dimensionality methods
                  focus on preserving local distances in data space,
                  the GP-LVM focusses on exactly the opposite. Being a
                  smooth mapping from latent to data space, it
                  focusses on keeping things apart in latent space
                  that are far apart in data space. In this paper we
                  first provide an overview of dimensionality
                  reduction techniques, placing the emphasis on the
                  kind of distance relation preserved. We then show
                  how the GP-LVM can be generalized, through back
                  constraints, to additionally preserve local
                  distances. We give illustrative experiments on
                  common data sets.}

  abstract =	 {{\bf Motivation:} Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are
                  currently the most widely used microarray
                  technology. Many summarisation methods have been
                  developed to provide gene expression levels from
                  Affymetrix probe-level data. Most of the currently
                  popular methods do not provide a measure of
                  uncertainty for the expression level of each
                  gene. The use of probabilistic models can overcome
                  this limitation. A full hierarchical Bayesian
                  approach requires the use of computationally
                  intensive MCMC methods that are impractical for
                  large data sets. An alternative computationally
                  efficient probabilistic model, mgMOS, uses Gamma
                  distributions to model specific and non-specific
                  binding with a latent variable to capture variations
                  in probe affinity. Although promising, the main
                  limitations of this model are that it does not use
                  information from multiple chips and that it does not
                  account for specific binding to the mismatch (MM)
                  probes.\\\\ {\bf Results:} We extend mgMOS to model
                  the binding affinity of probe-pairs across multiple
                  chips and to capture the effect of specific binding
                  to MM probes. The new model, multi-mgMOS, provides
                  improved accuracy, as demonstrated on some
                  bench-mark data sets and a real time-course data
                  set, and is much more computationally efficient than
                  a competing hierarchical Bayesian approach that
                  requires MCMC sampling. We demonstrate how the
                  probabilistic model can be used to estimate
                  credibility intervals for expression levels and
                  their log-ratios between conditions.\\\\ {\bf
                  Availability:} Both mgMOS and the new model
                  multi-mgMOS have been implemented in an R package
                  that is currently available from

                  operations are therefore precluded (e.g.~matrix
                  inverse $O(m^3)$) when data-sets containing more
                  than about 10^4 points are encountered. One approach
                  to resolving these issues is to look for sparse
                  representations of the data-set A sparse
                  representation contains a reduced number of
                  examples. Loosely speaking we are interested in
                  extracting the maximum amount of information from
                  the minimum number of data-points. To achieve this
                  in a principled manner we are interested in
                  estimating the amount of information each data-point
                  contains. In the framework presented here we make
                  use of the Bayesian methodology to determine how
                  much information is gained from each data-point.},

                  overview of some existing techniques for discovering
                  such embeddings. We then introduce a novel
                  probabilistic interpretation of principal component
                  analysis (PCA) that we term dual probabilistic PCA
                  (DPPCA). The DPPCA model has the additional
                  advantage that the linear mappings from the embedded
                  space can easily be non-linearised through Gaussian
                  processes. We refer to this model as a Gaussian
                  process latent variable model (GPLVM). We develop a
                  practical algorithm for GPLVMs which allow for
                  non-linear mappings from the embedded space giving a

                  their practical applicability has been limited by
                  the difficulty of finding an effective learning
                  algorithm. One well-established approach, known as

                  and the advent of third generation mobile phones,
                  wireless communications are becoming increasingly
                  important. Many applications rely on the device
                  maintaining a \emph{replica} of a data-structure
                  which is stored on a server, for example news
                  databases, calendars and e-mail. In this paper we
                  explore the question of the optimal strategy for
                  synchronising such replicas. We utilise
                  probabilistic models to represent how the
                  data-structures evolve and to model user
                  behaviour. We then formulate objective functions
                  which can be minimised with respect to the
                  synchronisation timings. We demonstrate, using two
                  real world data-sets, that a user can obtain more
                  up-to-date information using our approach.},

  abstract =	 {One of the key objectives of modern artificial
                  intelligence is the handling of
                  uncertainty. Probability theory provides a framework
                  for handling of uncertainty in a principled
                  manner. Probabilistic inference is the process of
                  reasoning under uncertainty and as such is vital for
                  both learning and decision making in probabilistic
                  models. For many models of interest this inference
                  proves to be intractable and to make progress
                  approximate methods need to be considered. This
                  thesis concerns itself with a particular
                  approximating formalism known as variational
                  inference \cite{Jordan:variational98}. Variational
                  inference has the advantage that it often provides
                  bounds on quantities of interest, such as
                  marginalised likelihoods. In this thesis we describe
                  a general framework for the implementation of the
                  variational approach. We then explore the approach
                  in several different probabilistic models including
                  undirected and directed graphs, Bayesian neural
                  networks and independent component analysis. In
                  those models which have been handled using
                  variational inference previously we show how we may
                  improve the quality of our inference engine by
                  considering more complex variational
                  distributions. },

                  obtained from microarray experiments through the
                  extraction of pixel intensities from a scanned image
                  of the slide. It is widely acknowledged that
                  variabilities can occur in expression levels
                  extracted from the same images by different users
                  with the same software packages. These
                  inconsistencies arise due to differences in the
                  refinement of the placement of the microarray
                  `grids'. We introduce a novel automated approach to
                  the refinement of grid placements that is based upon
                  the use of Bayesian inference for determining the
                  size, shape and positioning of the microarray
                  `spots', capturing uncertainty that can be passed to
                  downstream analysis.\\\\ {\bf Results:} Our
                  experiments demonstrate that variability between
                  users can be significantly reduced using the
                  approach. The automated nature of the approach also

                  regulatory relationship between transcription
                  factors and genes is a fundamental stepping stone
                  when trying to develop models of cellular
                  processes. This task, however, is difficult for a
                  number of reasons: transcription factors' expression
                  levels are often low and noisy, and many
                  transcription factors are post-transcriptionally
                  regulated. It is therefore useful to infer the
                  activity of the transcription factors from the
                  expression levels of their target genes.\\\\ {\bf
                  Results:} We introduce a novel probabilistic model
                  to infer transcription factor activities from
                  microarray data when the structure of the regulatory
                  network is known. The model is based on regression,
                  retaining the computational efficiency to allow
                  genome-wide investigation, but is rendered more
                  flexible by sampling regression coefficients
                  independently for each gene. This allows us to
                  determine the strength with which a transcription
                  factor regulates each of its target genes, therefore
                  providing a quantitative description of the
                  transcriptional regulatory network. The
                  probabilistic nature of the model also means that we
                  can associate credibility intervals to our estimates
                  of the activities. We demonstrate our model on two
                  yeast data sets. In both cases the network structure
                  was obtained using Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                  data. We show how predictions from our model are
                  consistent with the underlying biology and offer
                  novel quantitative insights into the regulatory
                  structure of the yeast cell.\\\\ {\bf Availability:}

                  relatively easy to measure, such as mRNA decay rates
                  and mRNA abundance levels, it is still very hard to

                  and the sensitivity of target genes to these

Design choices in implementation of an algorithm can have a significant effect on the quality of results. Decisions such as model initializaiton and data pre-processing are all part of the implementation. Necessarily, space constraints sometimes mean that such details are not included in the associated paper. It seems clear that the paper only tells part of the story. Implementations need to be made available at the time of submission of the paper, so that the full story may be followed. In our research group we have done this since 2001.

                 expression studies has been to cluster the expression
                 profiles and look for coregulated genes within
                 clusters. Within systems biology mechanistic models
                 of gene expression are typically constructed through
                 differential equations. mRNA's production is taken to
                 be proportional to transcription factor activity
                 (with the proportionality given by the sensitivity)
                 and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a particular
                 rate. The assumption that coregulated genes have
                 similar profiles is equivalent to assuming both the
                 decay and the sensitivity are high.

                In this talk we advocate model based target
                identification. We develop a simple probabilistic
                models of transcription (and translation) which encode
                mRNA (or Transcription Factor) production and
                decay. Our models are simple enough to allow genome
                wide target identification, but rich enough to encode
                dynamical behavior that, allowing us to identify
                putative targets even when decay rates are low.}

                 assumptions are used (\emph{e.g.} Kalman filters or

                 In this talk we will consider the more general case
                 where the latent variable is a forcing function in a
                 differential equation model. We will show how for
                 some simple ordinary differential equations the
                 latent variable can be dealt with analytically for
                 particular Gaussian process priors over the latent
                 force. In this talk we will introduce the general
                 framework, present results in systems biology and

                 have become an integral part of biological data analysis. 
                 The growth in data availability has necessitated their use 
                 in summarization of the data (e.g. \emph{statistical} 
                 approaches such as hierarchical clustering). Simultaneously, 
                 as more has become understood about the mechanisms 
                 underpinning particular pathways \emph{mechanistic} 
                 models of interactions have become more widespread.\\\\


                 The data-driven statistical approach and the mechanistic 
                 model approach each have their advantages. Data-driven models 
                 can be used in genome wide analyses to 'fish' for genes that 
                 were not known to be relevant but provide a critical role in 
                 a pathway. Mechanistic models make real predictions about how 
                 systems will respond given particular interventions. The two 
                 approaches have interacted only loosely, often not through 
                 interaction between the `mathematicians' but through indirect 
                 interaction via the biologists. \\\\

                 In this talk we will follow describe a statistical analysis 
                 `pipeline' for microarray data which handles the noise in 
                 the data. As we proceed down the pipeline we will come closer 
                 to mechanistic models of systems. We will finish with some 
                 general thoughts about the contribution that a combined

  abstract =  	 {Each cell in the human body contains the same basic code 
                 in the form of the genome, however cells have differentiated

                 different genes. 
                 
                 Key insights into gene interactions can be studied through 
                 measuring the level of expression of each gene at different 
                 times. Gene expression levels can be obtained from cDNA 
                 microarray experiments through the extraction of pixel
                 intensities from a scanned image of a slide. 

                 In this talk we will start by briefly reviewing cDNA
                 microarray technology. We will then focus on one
                 problem that arises when processing these images:
                 human error in locating the position of the spots can
                 lead to variabilities in the extracted expression
                 levels. We will present a Bayesian approach to the image
                 processing which alleviates this problem. Our
                 approach makes use of a novel combination of
                 importance sampling and variational approximations.
 
                 Finally if there is time we will briefly show some examples 
                 of the variational importance sampler applied to visual 
                 tracking problems.},

                 optimising with respect to the latent variables also
                 leads to PCA. The marginalised likelihood in this

                 substituting the linear covariance function for a

                  the SVM's margin: a characteristic which is not

                 likelihoods are sharply peaked or state spaces are
                 high dimensional. This failure is caused by a
                 mismatch between the proposal distribution and the
                 true posterior. The number of particles of samples
                 then required to accurately represent the posterior
                 increases dramatically and with it the computational
                 demands of the algorithm.

                 By formulating the problem within the framework of
                 variational inference we derive an algorithm in which
                 the proposal naturally adapts to more accurately

                 replacing intractable moment evaluations, arising

  title = {Animation by Machine Learning with Motion Capture Data},
  abstract = {This project is about using Machine Learning to model human motion for animation, with a particular focus on the demands of computer games. The idea is to learn what natural motion looks like, and then combine it with constraints to develop an animation sequence. The constraints could be animator imposed, or imposed by the computer game. A typical scenario might be that the player's character is required to interact with a character in the game, for example a player might be given an object in the game. The constraint could be that the hands of the player touch the hands of the character giving the object. With the current approach to animation (looking up a library of motion capture data) such a constraint is very difficult to fulfill as the required motion won't exactly match a sequence in the library. By modelling natural motion through machine learning, we should be able to generate a new sequence to satisfy the constraint.\\\\ 

The models of motion will be developed using Gaussian processes. In particular the project will make use of the "Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model" (Lawrence, 2003) which has already shown a lot of promise in this domain, and "Latent Force Models" (Alvarez et al, 2009) a recently developed approach to learning based on physics and probabilistic models. \\\\

Biological systems are immensely complex, and extracting all the data necessary to characterize the system is often impossible. It is therefore important to exploit other sources of information when modelling biological systems. Once such source of information is "mechanistic models". These are models of the underlying physical properties of the system. In this project we will ensure that such physical models can be easily combined with data driven machine learning approaches, aiming to obtain the best of both worlds: mechanistic modelling and data driven machine learning models. \\\\

  abstract = {The increased ability to measure individuals' genetic profiles ( through single nucleotide polymorphisms), combined with the ability to characterize a disease activity through gene expression, and other biomarkers, should reveal more realistically complex webs of causal factors for disease. Understanding these causal factors would enable personalised interventions targeted to an individual's genetic, environmental (including concurrent treatments) and treatment preference profile. \\\\

This vision is challenging on two fronts: first, integration of different sources of (genomic) biological data is not straightforward; second, environments are not artificially controlled. In practice, disease occurrence and progression is often triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors need to be assimilated with the genetic background (through the genomic data) and placed in a unified modelling framework to characterize the disease. \\\\

The objective of this project is to address these issues. Our aim is to perform statistical inference from these models to enable us to resolve the determinants of a given disease and its responses to treatments. The research will involve amalgamation of several different research areas, covering health, biology, computational and statistical inference. \\\\

The genome is the same in each cell, but which genes are switched on (or expressed) is determined by transcription factors. Unfortunately these transcription factors (which are in the form of proteins) are difficult to measure directly. However, microarray technology (and recently 3rd generation sequencing technology) allow us to make measurements of the gene expression across the genome. We can make indirect inference about the transcription factor activities from this information. In this project software for making these inferences from real data will be developed within the Bioconductor framework using the R programming language, allowing biologists to infer transcription factor activities across the genome.
